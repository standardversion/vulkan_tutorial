# Vertex Buffers

# ðŸ§¶ Vertex Buffers â€“ Feeding Geometry to the GPU

> Stores the vertex data (positions, colors, normals, etc.) your shaders will process.

- `vkCreateBuffer` â€“ creates a buffer object  
- `vkAllocateMemory` & `vkBindBufferMemory` â€“ reserve and bind GPU memory  
- `vkMapMemory`, `memcpy`, `vkUnmapMemory` â€“ upload data to the buffer  

**Purpose**: Vertex buffers are **how you tell Vulkan what to draw**. They hold the raw geometry that your vertex shader consumes.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:
- **Buffer** = a memory container (like an empty box)
- **Vertex Buffer** = a buffer with structured geometry inside
- **Binding** = telling the pipeline where your box is and how to interpret it

---

## ðŸ§© Input Descriptions â€“ Making Sense of Vertex Data

> Vulkan needs explicit descriptions of what your vertex data looks like.

- `VkVertexInputBindingDescription` â€“ stride, input rate  
- `VkVertexInputAttributeDescription` â€“ format, offset, location  

These get passed into the pipeline creation (`VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo`).

**Purpose**: Tells Vulkan:  
_"Each vertex is X bytes, and hereâ€™s where each attribute lives."_

## ðŸ“¤ Uploading Vertex Data â€“ CPU â†’ GPU

Steps:
1. Create a `VkBuffer` with usage `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT`
2. Allocate memory (`vkAllocateMemory`) with appropriate flags (like `HOST_VISIBLE`)
3. Copy vertex data using `vkMapMemory` + `memcpy` + `vkUnmapMemory`
4. (Optional but preferred) Use a **staging buffer** and `vkCmdCopyBuffer` for best performance

ðŸš€ **Staging Buffer Tip**:  
Upload from CPU to a temporary buffer (host-visible), then copy to a GPU-local buffer for efficient access during rendering.

---

## ðŸª¢ Binding Buffers in the Draw Call

> Once you have a buffer, you need to bind it before drawing.

- `vkCmdBindVertexBuffers` â€“ binds vertex buffer(s) to a command buffer  
- `vkCmdDraw` â€“ draws geometry using currently bound buffers

ðŸ“˜ Example:
```cpp
VkBuffer vertexBuffers[] = { vertexBuffer };
VkDeviceSize offsets[] = { 0 };
vkCmdBindVertexBuffers(commandBuffer, 0, 1, vertexBuffers, offsets);
vkCmdDraw(commandBuffer, vertexCount, 1, 0, 0);
```

# Index Buffers

# ðŸ”¢ Index Buffers â€“ Reusing Vertex Data Efficiently

> Stores the indices that reference vertices in your vertex buffer, allowing reuse and reducing duplication.

- `vkCreateBuffer` â€“ create a buffer for indices  
- `vkAllocateMemory` & `vkBindBufferMemory` â€“ allocate and bind memory  
- `vkMapMemory`, `memcpy`, `vkUnmapMemory` â€“ upload index data to the buffer  

**Purpose**: Index buffers enable **efficient reuse** of vertex data. Instead of duplicating vertices, you reference them by index â€” especially useful for drawing complex meshes.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:
- **Vertex Buffer** = list of points (e.g., A, B, C, D)
- **Index Buffer** = instructions on how to connect them (e.g., draw triangle A-B-C, then A-C-D)

---

## ðŸ§® Index Types â€“ 16-bit vs. 32-bit

> Vulkan supports different index formats, based on your mesh size.

- `VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16` â€“ up to 65,535 unique vertices  
- `VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32` â€“ for large models with more vertices  

ðŸ’¡ Use `uint16_t` when possible to save memory and bandwidth.

---

## ðŸ“¤ Uploading Index Data â€“ CPU â†’ GPU

Steps:
1. Create a `VkBuffer` with `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDEX_BUFFER_BIT`
2. Allocate memory with `vkAllocateMemory` and bind with `vkBindBufferMemory`
3. Upload the index array using `vkMapMemory`, `memcpy`, and `vkUnmapMemory`
4. (Optional) Use a **staging buffer** and copy it to GPU-local memory via `vkCmdCopyBuffer`

---

## ðŸª¢ Binding and Using Index Buffers in Draw Call

- `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer` â€“ binds an index buffer to a command buffer  
- `vkCmdDrawIndexed` â€“ issues a draw using indices from the bound buffer

ðŸ“˜ Example:
```cpp
vkCmdBindIndexBuffer(commandBuffer, indexBuffer, 0, VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32);
vkCmdDrawIndexed(commandBuffer, indexCount, 1, 0, 0, 0);
```
